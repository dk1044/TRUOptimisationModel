This file contains the dissertation work for the optimisation of the Transpennine train route. It uses ant colony optimisation and rescheduling techniques in order to minimise knock on delays caused by railway incidents. Inside the simulation, train delays are purposefully caused so the number of propagating delays can be measured. Please read 'Optimisation of Train Scheduling to Reduce Delay Propagation' for my details
